# Smart-Sprint-Tracker-System

The smart sprint tacker represents an innovative Arduino project designed to assist sprinters by monitoring their track performance regarding speed and time measurements. Users can input lap count before commencing the system which tracks all measurements throughout each lap. Sprinter functions independently to begin and stop its timer operation. The system will allow users to decide between starting and ending the sprint based on their personal preferences. The sprint conclusion displays detailed information about individual laps and complete sprint statistics to users.
Trackers present a major challenge for sprinters and all athletes when they need to measure their training times precisely. The traditional methods used to measure sprint durations suffer from numerous errors which stem primarily from human mistakes because another person must begin and stop the timer. Sprinters require an additional person to monitor their performance development during this process. The Solution Smart sprint tracker delivers precise measurement results for all these metrics while requiring no human assistance.
The smart sprint tracker system functions through the implementation of inexpensive hardware elements. This inexpensive device enables sprinters to utilize it during regular practice sessions and official games. The device will monitor speed and lap times while sprinters can link to the system through Bluetooth using their sport watches. The system allows users to change the order of start and finish points to suit their training needs.
